                            used Python and Flask for
                            the REST API. This is the first that I have used Python for a REST API. I made a few
                            different branches that used MongoDB for
                            the database and one that used MySQL Database. The front end is Spring Java and using
                            Thymeleaf-Bootstrap for the UI.</p>

        <h5>Research</h5>
        <br>

        <div class="row">

            <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12">

                <p class="card-body grey-text">
                    Last month I made weekly trips to county of a family of mine, Union County.
                    I had been meaning to go and conduct research and I finally made the trip. It has boosted my
                    research immensely. Not only in my knowledge of my family but my research skills. One of the resources I found
                    an abundance on is profiles of certain people. These profiles included descriptions of them, their life, travels,
                    experience and such. A lot of these profiles were of Civil War soldier. This has inspired me to try
                    and build more of these type profiles for other family members.<br><br>

                    My trip included visiting cemeteries, Heritage Room, and library for information. My next trip will include
                    visiting the courthouse. I have not visited lately. I am still going through the data I've collected the
                    last few trips. As well as working on the to-do list for the trip. I always go with a plan to have to
                    most productive time there since I cannot visit often.

        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <br>

        <div class="row">

            <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12">

                <p class="card-body grey-text">
                    The last thing I want to touch on is just an overview of the week and how I am a better me than last week.<br><br>

                    Through making the bilingual project I am become even more so comfortable programming Python. Java by far up to
                    writing this is my most comfortable programming language. Along with that I am implementing some of the information
                    speakers have talked about in conferences I have listened to on YouTube about microservices. Using the language that best
                    benefits a certain function of the project and how they all come together to function as one whole unit.<br><br>

                    I was able to incorporate a new database that I am learning, MongoDB. I wanted to learn this because I am interested in
                    using it in a project I am working on, Bloodline Genealogy. This is project I plan to publish as a service in the future.
                    I am learning MongoDB to possible include to store certain types of data.<br><br>

                    My goal from the upcoming week to better myself even more so is to learn AJAX for processing POST and GET request. This will
                    be slightly different to how I've processed requests thus far. I am also going to continue with a project I have not published yet
                    to my GitHub which is a DateParser. This project is allowing users to enter multiple types of inputs for dates, regular formats (05 May 1945, 05/05/1945), dates that
                    include approximate dates, between two dates, before/after dates, etc.<br><br>

                    I look forward to writing next week with my second weekly post
