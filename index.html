			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Currently a senior at Gardner-Webb University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Sports Management.  Fitness has been
				a part of my life for several years now.  After taking an intro to Java class I found out how passionate I am about coding.  I
				spend a huge chunk of my free time doing what I love, making software, bettering my coding skills.  Currently building software I wish there were software or
				had the features I want when doing one of my <a href="#outside">hobbies</a> such as working out and genealogy.
