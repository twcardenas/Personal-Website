                    The second week is here! I did not code as much as I would like. But I made progress nonetheless. My goal
                    for the next is to get closer to solving the token based authorization in my microservice project. As well as I
                    want to make next weeks post more unique in the layout of the page. I did not change it too much this week.

                            I haven't published this. But I made a UI I liked and did lots of reading on how I can
                            implement a token based authorization for a project made up of multiple microservices. To have one of those
                            services being the auth service.<br><br>

                            I've understood how to implement the auth service within a single application. My issue is how to
                            the other services can have to the token to get the user object to tell who is logged in, if they are logged in.<br><br>

                            Right now I am trying to implement this in a Python-Flask Project, but later there will different languages
                            that will need access to the token.

                                I saw this commercial about this AI technology that is reconstructing historic places. My first thought is why this is amazing, something
                                like this would be great for reconstructing towns, homes, heirlooms. Preserve these memories forever. Even if they are gone. To be able to
                                reconstruct my families childhood home through pictures, memories, etc. And be able to have a timeline of change within the home such as the
                                addition of other buildings, changes of surroundings, interior. To be able to relive something like that is so valuable.

                                3D modeling, turning 2D into 3D models is something I am doing research on currently. Just to learn more and possible future projects.

                            I enjoyed this video from one of my favorite YouTubers. He is talking about differences between working at small and large
                            companies. At small companies you tend to use a very wide set of skills. You'll work on a lot of different things.

                            And that youngsters will say they do many things but later you will describe yourself as you do one thing really reall

                            On design of the video, I really liked the video background with overlays of the slides and the a smaller version of the video
                            playing in the foreground. I'm working on learning video skills and I thought it was an interesting design.

                    I to run some errands in Newton, afterwards I did some genealogy research while I was in the area.
                    Sadly the genealogy room in Newton Library is closed on Monday so I was unable to go. However the Lincolnton Library
                    was open. I made my first stop at this library.<br><br>

                    My first thoughts was that it was one of the smaller rooms I've been to. As per usual, I spent my first ten minutes
                    walking around getting a bit of an idea of what they had there. Then continued to look at the vertical files and family history books.
                    These books are the ones unique to this library. My local library and genealogy library has majority of the land, marriage, and deed information.<br><br>

                    Information I got from this trip was a lot on supplemental lines I am researching for their high crossover into my family.<br><br>

                    I had to make a trip to Charlotte as well. My exam was not until 5pm so this day I decide to spend the time before on research as well. This
                    time at the Concord Library. This library had a lot more than the Lincolnton library. One thing I found interesting was a book on my ancestors. It was
                    highly documented and the way the author recorded the documents was quite interesting. Not many books had recorded data in the way he has that I've seen.<br><br>

                    This week was a successful research. I made sure to back up my data today as I do every week. As for the following week I plan to continue
                    going through the data I've gathered, validate and see what research on the Coast of North Carolina I need. I plan to head that way to visit
                    family and will stop and research at Libraries in Onslow County and adjacent counties.<br><br>
