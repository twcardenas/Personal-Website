                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>Sometimes we need to take a step back from what we are doing and do something else. I spent the past few days really into study and coding. Then yesterday after doing the same for about six hours I started to feel overwhelmed. Then decided to take the rest of the day off. Worked on my genealogy, YouTube page, games. I had so much going through my brain on things to work on I wasn’t getting any one of them done.
                    <br><br>
                    After my days rest I am coming back to continue my work on building a small and simple PWA. I started building an application that expanded way to fast and got super complicated. I need to start smaller and simpler.
                    <br><br>
                    As well I need to work on my workflow. My commits and branches are feeling sloppy and all over the place. And mostly my READMEs.
                    <br><br>
                    But these are the things I’m thinking about and working on.

                <h2>twcardenas.github.io</h2>
                <p>
                    I made some changes to my website. The main addition was to my Bloodline genealogy page. I added information about the projects I am working on for it.
                    <br><br>
                    Am still adding sample works of my research to the page.

                <h2>Python Neo4j Convertor</h2>
                <p>
                    I added Batch Inserts. The performance was not going to be good for large gedcoms. So thus far I’ve converted data into a CSV file from the GEDCOM. A CSV for each person, family, name, and then one for relationship between person and family.
                </p>

                <h2>Node.js | Angular 6 | Python | Express | PWA</h2>
                <p>
                    I took an existing Node.js, Angular and Express with authorization to learn how to also add another language REST API that also incorporates the JWT token. This exercise was successful. This had been an issue I’ve been trying to resolve for a while now. Properly using/implementing an Authorization/Authentication web app.
                    <br><br>
                    The next step was to transform the application into a progressive web app.

                <h2>Future Development</h2>
                <p>
                    With successfully implementing an account system I am adding it to my Bloodline Genealogy project. So, the questions I have now is:
                    <ul>
                <li>What makes a good secret key? Blacklisting, revoking, expiration dates</li>

                <li>Email verification?</li>
                <li>Form validation in Angular?</li>
                <li>And what other security measures should I implement?</li>
                <li>Probably some of the concepts I learned in Security and Privacy course such as hashing, salting, etc.</li>
                <li>Checking the data for SQLi, and XSS</li>
            </ul>
                <p>I want to practice using Docker as well, so I will try to create a container, or multiple? I will do research on the topic and determine the best course and will update the code on GitHub.

                <p>
                    I got Visual Studios and I’ve been test running it the past week. It is pretty nice. I still kind of prefer IntelliJ a bit more but I do use Visual Studios for my Angular and Node applications.
                    <br><br>
                    Adobe Creative Cloud – Got Adobe CC this week and working on getting better at these tools. Creating a logo for my genealogy business, thumbnails for my videos, video production, etc.
