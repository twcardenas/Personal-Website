                Thomas Cardenas is currently a senior computer science student. His focus has been in web development with practice in both 
                front-end and back-end. In 2019 he will be graduating from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a BS in Computer Science
                 with a concentration in software engineering, minor in mathematics.
                <br><br>
                During his last year, Thomas is working on building a website for the Bioinformatics Department at UNC-Charlotte to display data 
                gathered by their researchers. When he is not doing that, he is enhancing his skills dealing microservices for the web and cloud platforms.
                <br><br>
                A majority of his free time is learning how he can improve his coding and practicing new technologies. He tries to apply what he 
                is studying to what he is doing currently and towards his hobbies. Such as creating tools to assist his love for genealogy research.
                <br><br>
                Lifelong student, but currently looking for new opportunities in web development and can be reached either through his LinkedIn profile or
