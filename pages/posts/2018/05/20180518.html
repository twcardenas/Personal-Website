                    Another week is in the books, did you make any progress on your goals? I know I did! Got my grades back from
                    school did well. I learned Neo4J, an awesome tool that I will talk about later. I really enjoy this design of this post.
                    It's my favorite yet. Still only slight changes from last week, but changes nonetheless. The color scheme came from the Primer League Page.
                    I saw their website and was inspired to make my post with their color scheme. I very much enjoyed using their site. The cool interactions like hovering
                    over a text and the corresponding image would scale up. The nav bar was sweeet.

                    Genealogy and coding are some of my things to do. Genealogy has a tons of relationships. Ancestors,
                    descendants, in-laws, etc, etc.

                    Graph databases would be wonderful to store a visualize of this information as well as traverse. I have not worked with
                    graph databases till now. I have read about them but
                    am happy to finally work with some.
                    <br><br>

                    <a href="https://markhneedham.com/blog/2012/07/21/neo4j-embracing-the-sub-graph/">"Keep your data
                        model rich! Don't be afraid to have as many relationships as you need. The power of graph
                        databases comes from finding surprising
                        results when you have strongly interconnected data."</a>
                    <br><br>

                    The <a href="https://tech.findmypast.com/graphical-family-tree/">FindMyPast</a> was by far my
                    favorite. It was extremely helpful.
                    The author provided a lot of example queries, actual data, and visuals that made understanding the
                    topic very easy.

                    I practiced with a variety of tools, Spring Data, Python using different drivers. My preference so far is with
                    Python and the drivers. It has been for me to persist the data. The wide range of dependencies there are and different
                    versions for Neo4J made learning a headache.<br><br>

                    Neo4J provided many examples easy to learn and useful, even for drivers that
                    they do not support. I am going to continue using Neo4J with Python for now. I may later go back and try again with Spring and Java.

                    <br><br>

                    Overall I really enjoy using Neo4J and will probably use it a lot more in my future projects.

                    database. This time I am trying python and neo4j. I like it. It's nice being able to see the relations and I think the graph database fits
                    this type of data very well.

                    View the repo branch on GitHub so see what I've features the program has thus far and what is on my to do list.

                    I made a <a href="#">CodePen</a> profile and am starting to add some of the web design I am practicing. The first pen I posted
                    was of pen about making a container that would statistics about a subject. An element would have a series of rows, about 4-5, and each
                    row would have either two or three boxes. Each box would have centered a large number and a small text representing the meaning of that
                    number.

                    Another post I made was on trying to have a grid of three images, with one large image, about 66% percent of the container, and two
                    images stacked of equal size that keep their size and the image fits with inside. The images could be of different sizes and the images
                    would adjust to the container and not the container to the images.

                    Posted my first video this week. The original schedule for this video was last week but still learning video making and editing delayed me a
                    short bit. But I got it done and am still planning on publishing one next week. Keeping to every Friday I'll post a video about genealogy research.
                    <br><br>
                    I hope to add some more flavor to the editing as I am learning. More special effects and better quality of recording. That was the main thing about this video I
                    learned I need improvement on. Going to practicing editing with Adobe Premiere for next week.
                    <br><br>
                    The video is not the best but I will get better and improve at explanation of concepts.

                <p>DotA has been really the only game I've played in the past two years. It's one of my favorite, obviously. They have a Major (a big prize pool tournament) this week.
                I have been listening/watching as I do my work on another monitor. The event is in China so the games start at like 11pm my time and end about 10am. I am able to catch
                a few live. I get up about 4-5 so I see about five games.<br><br>Not coding related, just an event I watched for my own enjoyment. Watching more skillful players play the game I enjoy,
                and I sometimes learn a few new tricks.</p>

                    The information I've been looking at is the Cabarrus County families. I am taking a small break from Union County research.
                    A few of those families came to Cabarrus, not much though.
