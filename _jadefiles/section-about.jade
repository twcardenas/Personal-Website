      p Currently a senior at UNC-Charlotte majoring in Computer Science-Software Engineering with a minor in German. Fitness has been a part of my life for several years now. After taking an intro to Java class I found out how passionate I am about coding. I spend a huge chunk of my free time doing what I love, making software, bettering my coding skills. Currently building software I wish there were software or had the features I want when doing one of my hobbies such as working out and genealogy.
